# vim-cmake-syntax
Vim syntax highlighting rules for modern CMake.

The vim syntax rules shipped with vim are out-of-date. These ones are less so.

Modified version because the standard cmake syntax and this one do not highlight correctly on my machine on for example
escaped quotes within strings or variables within strings.
